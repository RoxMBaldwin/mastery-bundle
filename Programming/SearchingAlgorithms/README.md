## Programming: Searching Algorithms

### Breadth-First Search
An alogrithm for traversing a tree or graph
- starts at the root
  - explore nodes in the order we find them in
- explores the neighbor nodes first before moving to the next level of neighbors
- can use it to track the minimum distance every vertex is from a given source vertex
*stack*

### Depth-First Seach
An alogrithm for traversing a tree or graph
- starts at the root // whatever node of the graph
- explores as far possible along the branch before backtracking
*queue*
