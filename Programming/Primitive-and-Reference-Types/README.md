### List types and describe which ones are primitive and which are reference types
|Primitive    |             |                               |
|------------:|------------:|------------------------------:|
|String       | ```'clowns'```    | used to represent textual data|
|Number       | ```666```         | can be used for all numbers including floats, +Infinity, -Infinity and NaN|
|Boolean      |  ```false```      | a conclusion represented by true or false|
|Undefined    | ```undefined```| a variable that has not been assigned a value // we know that is has value, we just don't know what it is|
|Null         | ```null```| has one value and we know it is nothing|
*Primitive types are incapable of being changed*


|Reference    |             |                               |
