# Agile

Form of organization that focuses on completing one segment at a time / accomplishing one goals at a time rather than trying to do the whole this all at once.

Work in small chunks and have an open line of communication with clients


### Agile Values
**Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**

* collaborations to find a better process
* value individuals beliefs

**Working software over comprehensive documentation**

* just get it to work/ don't kill it with documentation
* focus on UX rather than something that is impossible to use

**Customer collaboration over contract negotiation**

* work with the target to figure out what they want
* easier to monitor change and more time efficient

 *this is the 'agile' part*

**Responding to change over following a plan**

* don't be worried about killing your babies / starting over on the code

### Velocity
Velocity is a capacity planning tool sometimes used in agile software development

Adds up “story points” in an iteration (sprint) and you use that data to estimate when you will finish the project

* constantly collecting data and then reflecting on it

### Retrospectives
**Format**

Stop | Start | Continue

**Purpose**

Reflect on what happened, ‘wins versus loses’, easier to continue or address success and failures

### Pair Programming
**[Extreme Programming](http://ronjeffries.com/xprog/what-is-extreme-programming/)**

XP-extreme programming, focuses on pair programming
Where its appropriate:
* Dynamically changing software requirements
* Risks caused by fixed time projects using new technology
* Small, co-located extended development team
* The technology you are using allows for automated unit and functional tests

**Values**
* Communication
* Simplicity
* Feedback
* Courage
* Respect

### Automated Tests
Code thats tested is gong to be better written and designed

### 'Half, Not Half-Assed'
Aim for a solid MVP that works over a ‘fluffy’ app that doesn't work
